Kozenigata Heiji quotes for anything can happen

Kozenigata Heiji is a fictional character from the anime and manga series "Lupin III", known for his memorable and comical one-liners. Here are some of his quotes that might relate to the idea that "anything can happen":

"In this world, there are only two things that are certain: death and anything can happen."

"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get. But in my line of work, it's usually a surprise party."

"Expect the unexpected, and you'll never be disappointed. Or at least you'll be pleasantly surprised when the unexpected is actually something good."

"The only thing we can be sure of in this world is that we can't be sure of anything."

"Life is full of surprises, some good, some bad, and some that are just plain weird. But that's what makes it interesting."

"There's no such thing as a sure thing. That's why we call them 'surprises'."

"The only way to be truly prepared for anything is to expect the unexpected. And then, when the unexpected happens, be ready to improvise."

I hope these quotes from Kozenigata Heiji will inspire you to embrace the uncertainty of life and be prepared for anything that comes your way!

java program to send gmail
Here's an example Java program using the JavaMail API to send an email via Gmail:

java
Copy code
import java.util.*;
import javax.mail.*;
import javax.mail.internet.*;

public class SendEmail {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      final String username = "your-email@gmail.com";
      final String password = "your-password";

      Properties props = new Properties();
      props.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");
      props.put("mail.smtp.starttls.enable", "true");
      props.put("mail.smtp.host", "smtp.gmail.com");
      props.put("mail.smtp.port", "587");

      Session session = Session.getInstance(props,
         new javax.mail.Authenticator() {
            protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
               return new PasswordAuthentication(username, password);
            }
         });

      try {
         Message message = new MimeMessage(session);
         message.setFrom(new InternetAddress("your-email@gmail.com"));
         message.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO,
            InternetAddress.parse("recipient-email@example.com"));
         message.setSubject("Testing Subject");
         message.setText("Dear Recipient,"
            + "\n\n This is a test email from Java.");

         Transport.send(message);

         System.out.println("Email sent successfully!");

      } catch (MessagingException e) {
         throw new RuntimeException(e);
      }
   }
}
Replace your-email@gmail.com and your-password with your Gmail credentials, and recipient-email@example.com with the recipient's email address.

Make sure to add the JavaMail API to your project's dependencies. You can download the latest version from here: https://javaee.github.io/javamail/

Also, note that Gmail may require additional configuration to allow less secure apps or app-specific passwords, depending on your account's security settings.

How to send gmail for multiple mails using java program
To send an email to multiple recipients using JavaMail API, you can modify the setRecipients() method call with an array of InternetAddress objects. Here's an example Java program that sends an email to multiple recipients:

java
Copy code
import java.util.*;
import javax.mail.*;
import javax.mail.internet.*;

public class SendEmail {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      final String username = "your-email@gmail.com";
      final String password = "your-password";

      Properties props = new Properties();
      props.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");
      props.put("mail.smtp.starttls.enable", "true");
      props.put("mail.smtp.host", "smtp.gmail.com");
      props.put("mail.smtp.port", "587");

      Session session = Session.getInstance(props,
         new javax.mail.Authenticator() {
            protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
               return new PasswordAuthentication(username, password);
            }
         });

      try {
         Message message = new MimeMessage(session);
         message.setFrom(new InternetAddress("your-email@gmail.com"));

         // List of email addresses to send the email
         InternetAddress[] recipients = { 
            new InternetAddress("recipient1@example.com"),
            new InternetAddress("recipient2@example.com"),
            new InternetAddress("recipient3@example.com")
         };
         
         message.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO, recipients);

         message.setSubject("Testing Subject");
         message.setText("Dear Recipients,"
            + "\n\n This is a test email from Java to multiple recipients.");

         Transport.send(message);

         System.out.println("Email sent successfully!");

      } catch (MessagingException e) {
         throw new RuntimeException(e);
      }
   }
}
In this example, the email will be sent to recipient1@example.com, recipient2@example.com, and recipient3@example.com. You can add or remove email addresses from the recipients array as needed.

SendEmail.java:2: error: package javax.mail does not exist
import javax.mail.*;
^
SendEmail.java:3: error: package javax.mail.internet does not exist
import javax.mail.internet.*;
The errors you are seeing indicate that the required JavaMail API is not in your classpath. To resolve this, you need to add the JavaMail API to your project's dependencies.

Here are the steps to add the JavaMail API to your project:

Download the latest version of the JavaMail API from here: https://javaee.github.io/javamail/

Extract the downloaded archive and find the javax.mail.jar file.

Add the javax.mail.jar file to your project's classpath. The exact steps to do this depend on your development environment. Here are a few common ways to add a JAR file to a classpath:

Eclipse: Right-click on your project in the Project Explorer, select Build Path > Configure Build Path, go to the Libraries tab, and click Add JARs. Select the javax.mail.jar file and click OK.

IntelliJ IDEA: Open the Project Structure dialog by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S, go to the Libraries tab, click the + button, and select Java. Navigate to the location of the javax.mail.jar file and select it.

Command line: If you are compiling your program from the command line, you can add the javax.mail.jar file to your classpath using the -cp option, like this:

bash
Copy code
javac -cp .:javax.mail.jar SendEmail.java
This assumes that the javax.mail.jar file is in the same directory as your SendEmail.java file. If it is in a different directory, replace the . with the directory path.

Once you have added the JavaMail API to your project's classpath, recompile your program and run it again. The errors should be resolved.

Error: Unable to initialize main class SendEmail
Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/mail/MessagingException
This error typically occurs when the JavaMail API JAR file is not properly included in the classpath at runtime. To resolve this error, you need to include the JavaMail API JAR file in the classpath when running your program.

Assuming you are using the command line to run your Java program, you can add the JavaMail API JAR file to the classpath using the -cp option, like this:

ruby
Copy code
java -cp .:path/to/javax.mail.jar SendEmail
This assumes that the javax.mail.jar file is in the path/to directory. Replace path/to with the actual directory path where the JAR file is located.

If you are using an integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, you can configure the classpath within the IDE itself. The exact steps to do this depend on the IDE you are using. Typically, you can add the JavaMail API JAR file to your project's build path or module dependencies.

Once you have added the JavaMail API JAR file to the classpath, run your program again. The error should be resolved.

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/activation/DataHandler
	at SendEmail.main(SendEmail.java:24)
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.activation.DataHandler
	at java.base/jdk.internal.loader.BuiltinClassLoader.loadClass(BuiltinClassLoader.java:641)

	at java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:521)
	... 1 more
This error typically occurs when the JavaMail API and its dependencies are not included in the classpath at runtime. The javax.activation.DataHandler class is part of the JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF), which is a required dependency of the JavaMail API.

To resolve this error, you need to include both the JavaMail API and the JAF JAR files in the classpath when running your program.

Assuming you are using the command line to run your Java program, you can add both JAR files to the classpath using the -cp option, like this:

ruby
Copy code
java -cp .:path/to/javax.mail.jar:path/to/activation.jar SendEmail
This assumes that both JAR files are in the path/to directory. Replace path/to with the actual directory path where the JAR files are located.

If you are using an integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, you can configure the classpath within the IDE itself. The exact steps to do this depend on the IDE you are using. Typically, you can add the JavaMail API and JAF JAR files to your project's build path or module dependencies.

Once you have added both JAR files to the classpath, run your program again. The error should be resolved.

give me the download link for activation jar
You can download the JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF) JAR file from the Oracle website. Here's the link to download the JAF 1.2.0 JAR file:

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javabeans-jaf-downloads.html

On the page, scroll down to the section "JavaBeans Activation Framework 1.2.0" and click the download link for "jaf-1_2_0.zip". Extract the contents of the ZIP file and you will find the activation.jar file in the lib directory.

Alternatively, you can also download the JAF JAR file from a Maven repository like this:

https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.activation/activation/1.1.1

This link provides the JAF 1.1.1 version. If you want to download a different version, simply change the version number in the link. You can download the JAR file by clicking on the "Files" link on the page and then selecting the JAR file to download.

the program is struck at Transpost.send(message);
If the program is stuck at the Transport.send(message) line, it is likely waiting for a response from the mail server. There could be a number of reasons why the program is not receiving a response, including network issues or incorrect server configuration.

Here are some things you can try:

Check your internet connection: Make sure that your computer is connected to the internet and that you can access other websites and services.

Check the SMTP server configuration: Make sure that you have provided the correct SMTP server address, port, username, and password. You can also try connecting to a different SMTP server to see if that resolves the issue.

Try running the program with debugging enabled: If you are using an IDE, you can enable debugging to see what is happening when the program gets stuck. You can also add debug statements to your code to help you identify the issue.

Check the mail server logs: If you have access to the mail server, you can check the server logs to see if there are any error messages or other issues that could be causing the program to hang.

Use a different email library: If none of the above solutions work, you could try using a different email library, such as Apache Commons Email or Spring Framework's JavaMailSender. These libraries provide a higher-level API that abstracts away some of the low-level details of sending email, and may be more reliable or easier to use in your specific scenario.

If none of the above solutions work, you may need to seek additional help from a technical expert or support team who can help you diagnose and resolve the issue.

It looks like you are providing the file paths for the SendEmail.java, javax.mail.jar, and activation.jar files as command line arguments to your program. However, simply providing the file paths as arguments does not automatically add them to the classpath.

To add these JAR files to the classpath when running your program, you need to specify them using the `-cp

The javax.mail.AuthenticationFailedException indicates that the program is not able to authenticate with the SMTP server using the provided credentials.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

Check your email and password: Make sure that you have provided the correct email address and password in the username and password variables in your program. You could also try logging into your email account using a web browser to make sure that your password is correct.

Allow access to less secure apps: If you are using a Gmail account, you may need to allow access to "less secure apps" in your account settings. To do this, go to your Google account settings and navigate to the "Security" tab. Scroll down to the "Less secure app access" section and turn on the toggle to allow less secure apps.

Use an app password: If you have enabled two-factor authentication on your email account, you may need to generate an "app password" to use with your program. This is a special password that you can generate from your account settings and use instead of your regular password in your program.

Check your account settings: Make sure that your email account is configured to allow access from the device or IP address you are using to run the program.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to seek additional help from a technical expert or support team who can help you diagnose and resolve the issue.
